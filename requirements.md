# Form Validation Using Constraint Validation API

1. Set up a blank HTML document

2. Think about how you would set up the different form
   elements and their accompanying validators. What objects
   and functions will you need? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding. The best thing you can do is whiteboard the entire solution before even touching the computer.
3. Write the simple form elements.
4. Add the JavaScript code that checks validation as the user progresses through the form. When a user leaves a form field, it should automatically validate that field.
5. Test out all possible cases.
6. Donâ€™t forget to style validations with CSS by using the :valid and :invalid pseudo-classes!
